# A Simple Alarm Clock

Hello! Welcome to my alarm clock app, a simple alarm clock that ticks down the time until you wake up.

**In order to use this app, open a terminal (either Powershell or the command prompt are recommended) and type "python app.py" to launch it.** 


## Python Features

###### 1. Master Loop
    (Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.)



###### 2. Countdown Timer
    (Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event.)



###### 3. Regular Expression - Timer
    (Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format.)


## Other Python Features

###### Logging Errors
    (Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.)


###### 5. Incomplete Code




## Thank You!

That's my JavaScript project. Thank you all; I hope you enjoy it a little! I have some ways to go before I understand JavaScript and other languages, but working on this project and getting help from mentors vastly improved my skills.
